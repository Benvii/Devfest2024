The GDG Nantes (Organisers of DevFest Nantes) is proud to be an open community that respects differences and diversity. We want all attendees (visitors, speakers, ‚Ä¶) to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. In order to guarantee an enriched experience at DevFest Nantes, we wanted to expose our choices and services allowing you to be included.

<br/>

## Environment üåç

### Goodies

This year, no Eco-cup or bag will be provided to participants. This decision was made because most of the participants already have everything they need and because even though the original intention of these objects was virtuous, their systematic distribution has the opposite effect and pollutes more than necessary.

<br/>

<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Therefore, ALL participants must bring one or more cups for their consumption during the Devfest and the after party.</strong></p>

<br/>

However, a T-shirt will still be given to participants, as they are widely used and therefore have the same effect as any T-shirt that participants could have purchased. The same goes for stickers. The quantity produced has nevertheless been greatly reduced to best match demand.

<br/>
Sponsors are also encouraged not to distribute goodies to participants.

### Local production

Most of our service providers are local, from Nantes or the surrounding area, and work, where possible, with local resources. There are budgetary issues, particularly with the production of T-shirts, which means that they are not currently produced in France, but the aim is to limit this kind of problem.

### Fighting waste

Leftover meals, furniture, and any resources that can be given are donated to associations. In addition, a stand allows participants to <strong>bring their old computer equipment</strong>, which will be reused by the association [ACIAH](https://aciah-formations-informatiques-pour-tous.fr/)

## Inclusivity / Accessiblity ü¶æ

### Breastfeeding room ü§±

If you wish, we can provide a dedicated room to pump your milk and store it in a refrigerator. To do so, please contact the DevFest reception so that we can set up a schedule and give you the key to the room. The location of this room will be communicated to you at that time.

### People with reduced mobility üßë‚Äçü¶Ω

The Cit√© des Congr√®s is an accessible venue. The rooms have dedicated spaces, the lifts are visible on the map on your badge.

### Deaf and Hard of Hearing ü¶ª

Since 2022, DevFest is equipped with a transcription system (velotype) in all conference rooms. The system in place is provided by the company "Les messageurs" and is a human transcription system and systematically available in the language of the conference. We advise you to position yourself in the first rows of the conference room to follow this system more comfortably. We do not offer translation of the transcription and we do not provide this service in the workshop rooms. 

### Reserved seats for pregnant women ü§∞

We offer pregnant women the opportunity to reserve seats in the conference rooms. In order to set up this system, we will need you to notify us before the Festival to identify the number of seats to reserve.

## Code of conduct üíÜ

### Light version of explicit ‚ÄúCode of Conduct policy‚Äù
