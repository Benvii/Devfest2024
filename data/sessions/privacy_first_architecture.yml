  Why and how modern developers could increase the privacy of modern Web.
   
  The popularity of clouds, the rise of huge monopolies across the internet, and the growth of shady data brokers recently have made the world a much more dangerous place for ordinary people—here is how we fix it.

  In this talk, Andrey Sitnik, the creator of PostCSS and the privacy-first open-source RSS reader, will explain how we can stop this dangerous trend and make the web a private place again.
  — Beginners will find simple steps, which can be applied to any website
  — Advanced developers will get practical insights into new local-first architecture
  — Privacy experts could find useful unique privacy tricks from a global world perspective and beyond just U.S. privacy risks
