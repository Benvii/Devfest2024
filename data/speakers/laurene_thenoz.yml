bio: |-
  I span through most organisational layers from manager to team member to CoDir member, from tech to product to organisation, from consulting to executing to training, and that makes me better at seeing things from a systemic point of view than being the expert on a specific domain.

  I use this strength to connect things, contextualise them, find strange metaphors, and share new and simpler ways to navigate the world we work in on a daily basis.

  These days I work as a data product manager for my clients and a manager, trainer and head of product within Hymaia.
