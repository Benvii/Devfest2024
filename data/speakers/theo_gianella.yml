bio: |-
  I am a former teacher/researcher in French literature who turned his life around in 2023 to become a web developer. I currently work as a front-end developer at Zenika in Lyon, on assignment for Bedrock Streaming where I participate in maintaining and enhancing the web apps for some of the biggest streaming platforms in Europe !

  The main thing I kept from my first career is a passion in talking to other people about the things I love or which spark my curiosity. I already had the chance to talk @Devoxx France in 2024 and soon @Breizhcamp !
