  Who am I? Whether it's as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, or Architect, if it involves software development, I'm in!

  My journey began in the realm of Java development, but I fully transitioned into the universe of JavaScript/TypeScript and its exciting toolset.

  I support companies through their software development cycle challenges by utilizing Nx monorepos, micro frontends, robust testing strategies, and a touch of Extreme Programming philosophy.

  Every day for me is like waiting for the next episode of my favorite seriesâ€”filled with learning, sharing, and growing together. Indeed, I'm as passionate about coaching and sharing knowledge as I am about coding.

  I am the father of two incredible boys, and I am endlessly grateful to my wife for supporting my passion every day.
